### Question 1. What is the Feynman Technique? Explain in 1 line.

Answer-> The Feynman Technique is a simple way to learn and retain information by pretending to teach it to a child, which helps you identify and fill in any gaps in your own understanding.

### Question 2. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
Answer-> The most interesting idea from this video is the concept of "diffuse mode" thinking. This means that our brains have two ways of working: focused and relaxed. We need to switch between these two modes to learn and be creative.

I found it fascinating that famous people like Salvador Dali and Thomas Edison used relaxation techniques to get new ideas. They would calm their minds to access their subconscious and create amazing art and inventions.

The video also shows that we can use simple techniques like taking breaks, exercising, and testing ourselves to improve our learning and memory. It's inspiring to know that our brains can do amazing things if we use the right strategies.

Overall, the video teaches us that understanding how our brains work can help us learn and be more creative.


### Question 3. What are active and diffused modes of thinking?
Answer-> Active Mode: In this mode, our brain is focused, concentrated, and actively working on a problem or task. It's like a spotlight shining on a specific area, trying to solve the problem or understand the concept. Our brain is actively processing information, making connections, and trying to find solutions.

Diffused Mode: In this mode, our brain is relaxed, not focused, and not actively working on a specific problem. It's like a lantern lighting up the entire room, allowing our brain to make connections and see relationships between different ideas and concepts. Our brain is in a state of relaxation, and our subconscious is free to roam and make new connections.

To illustrate the difference:

Active Mode: You're trying to solve a math problem, and your brain is focused on finding the solution.
Diffused Mode: You're taking a break, going for a walk, or daydreaming, and your brain is making connections between different ideas and concepts in the background.
The video suggests that we need to switch between these two modes to learn and be creative. By oscillating between focused attention and relaxation, we can tap into our brain's full potential and achieve greater understanding and innovation.

### Question 4. According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points.
Answer-> 1. Deconstruct the skill
         2. Learn enough to self-correct
         3. Remove barriers to practice
         4. Practice for at least 20 hours

Answer-> To improve your learning process, you can take the following actions:

1. **Practice deep work:** Focus on your work with 100% involvement, eliminating distractions and preserving your attention.

2. **Manage your time effectively:** Use tools like Todoist, TimeLimit, Freedom, or Boosted to track your time, block social media, and stay focused on your tasks.
