## Question 5: What are some ideas that you can implement to sleep better?
- **Regularity**: Go to bed and wake up simultaneously each day, even on weekends. This will help regulate your body's natural sleep-wake cycle.
- **Cool temperature**: Keep your bedroom temperature around 65 degrees Fahrenheit (18 degrees Celsius). This will help your body drop its core temperature, which is necessary for sleep.
- **Avoid naps during the day**: If you struggle to sleep at night, avoid napping during the day. This can make it harder to fall asleep at night.
- **Avoid alcohol and caffeine**: Alcohol and caffeine can interfere with sleep. Avoid them in the hours leading up to bedtime.
- **Create a relaxing bedtime routine**: Develop a relaxing routine before bed to signal to your body that it is time to wind down. This could include taking a warm bath, reading a book, or listening to calming music.
- **Get out of bed if you can't sleep**: If you are in bed for more than 20 minutes and can't fall asleep, get out of bed and go to another room. Do something relaxing until you feel tired. Then, go back to bed.
- **Make sure your bed is comfortable**: Your bed should be comfortable and supportive. Invest in a good mattress and pillows.
- **Light and darkness**: Ensure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and clutter-free. Darkness helps to signal to your body that it is time to sleep.

## Question 7: What are some steps you can take to exercise more?
- Aim for three to four 30-minute sessions of aerobic exercise each week. Aerobic exercise gets your heart rate up. Examples include brisk walking, running, swimming, biking, or dancing.
