### Question 1: Which point(s) were new to you?

**Answer:**
- **Detailed Reporting of Issues:** The suggestion to clearly explain problems, mention the solutions tried, and use visual aids like screenshots, diagrams, and screencasts was new to me. I typically provide a brief description of the problem but haven’t utilized tools like Loom or Github gists for sharing detailed context.
- **Deep Work and Attention Management:** The specific emphasis on managing phone notifications and blocking social media during work hours was new. I was aware of the concept of deep work but hadn’t considered implementing such specific strategies for minimizing distractions.

### Question 2: Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?

** Answer:**
- **Area for Improvement:** Over-communication, especially in scenarios where implementation is taking longer than expected or when facing technical issues. I sometimes wait too long to update the team, which can delay problem-solving and affect project timelines.

**Ideas for Progress:**
1. **Implement Regular Updates:** I plan to set up a routine for providing updates on my progress, especially if I encounter delays or issues. This could involve daily or bi-daily check-ins with the team or through project management tools.
2. **Use Communication Channels Effectively:** I will make a habit of using group chat channels for most communications to ensure that important information is visible to all relevant team members. This will also help me avoid the pitfalls of private messaging and ensure a more streamlined communication process.
3. **Be Proactive with Notifications:** I will be more proactive in notifying the team about potential delays or issues as soon as they arise, rather than waiting for a significant update. This includes setting reminders for myself to check in on ongoing issues and update the team accordingly.

By focusing on these areas, I hope to enhance both my personal productivity and the overall efficiency of our team.
